# AI Agent Development using the React (Reason + Act) Pattern

## Overview
The React (Reason + Act) Pattern is a design framework for building AI agents that reason through available information and take appropriate actions. It emphasizes a structured approach where the agent continuously evaluates its environment, reasons about the next steps, and acts accordingly.

## What is the React Pattern?
The React pattern, derived from "Reason + Act," defines how AI agents operate through two primary phases:

1. **Reason:** The agent analyzes its environment or incoming data to determine the best course of action. This includes processing input, applying logic, and updating its internal state.

2. **Act:** Based on its reasoning, the agent performs a task or takes an action, such as providing a response, making a recommendation, or adjusting its environment.

## Key Principles
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Agents base their actions on real-time data.
- **Event-Driven Logic:** Agents respond to specific triggers or environmental changes.
- **Modularity:** Components are designed independently and connected through logical workflows.
- **Context Awareness:** Agents maintain a state for better decision-making over time.

## Project Structure

│── main.py                # Core logic for the AI agent
│── agents/
│   └── react_agent.py    # Implementation of the React Pattern
│── models/
│   └── decision_model.py # Reasoning logic and state management
│── data/
│   └── input.json        # Example input data
│── config/
│   └── settings.yaml     # Configuration settings
│── tests/
│   └── test_agent.py     # Unit tests
└── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

## How It Works
1. **Initialize the Agent:** Load configurations and initialize the reasoning model.
2. **Receive Input:** Collect data from APIs, user input, or sensors.
3. **Reason:** Analyze the input using pre-defined logic.
4. **Act:** Perform an action based on the reasoning results.
5. **Feedback Loop:** Continuously process new data and adjust behavior.

## Example Workflow
```python
from agents.react_agent import ReactAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = ReactAgent()

# Simulate input
input_data = "Find the weather in New York."

# Run agent
response = agent.run(input_data)
print(response)
```
